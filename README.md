# Wsup

Personal repo for trying shit out, i will mainly write python code but who knows what can happen, maybe ill go crazy and decide to go to javascript or sth.

Contents so far :

* My answer / tests to TDD [greeting kata](https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/Greeting-Kata).
* Answer / Tests following Uncle Bob's implementation of a stack in [conference](https://youtu.be/58jGpV2Cg50?t=2632)
* Naive implementation of Conway's game of life

## Game of life

If you happen to want to try it out just clone the repo, and run :

``` bash
$ python -m game_of_life
```

It only supports random MxN initialisation, it's console displayed and you have to press enter (or any key but "n" for that matter) for passing to the next generation. However, I had a lot of fun making it so yeah enjoy I guess :^)

## Notion API

Testing out the [Notion Devleoppers API](https://developers.notion.com/) for retrieving, querying, creating databases and pages.
